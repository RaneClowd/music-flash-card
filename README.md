### Problem
I am learning how to play the piano. There is so much sheet music available and being able to play it has
been really fun and encouraging. But I feel that to make full use of the sheet music I need to be able to quickly
read it (rather than writing out the names of the notes).

### Solution
I want to be able to recognize a note by sight, and the best way for me to get there is to practice reading them using
a sort of flashcard approach. This little app will randomly display a note to me and I'll identify it. The app won't
verify anything for me so I'll be on the honor system (and I'm only hurting myself if I cheat).

So the complete behavior of the app is to constantly show me a random note, let me guess at it, and then show me the
correct answer. Rinse and repeat.
